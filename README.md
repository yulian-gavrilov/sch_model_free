Purpose:

Model-Free analysis of methyl dynamics in protein residues side chains
Written for the input of four relaxation rates
Small adjustments can be implemented to be used with less/more rates 
Required input: 
(1) side-chain methyl relaxation times (1/rates) from NMR experiments; 
(2) global protein tumbling time(s). Can be the same for all methyl groups (isotropic tumbling).
Or adjusted for each methyl group. To obtain it use Quadric software from Art Palmer Lab:
